## CS31520: Mobile Development with iOS
###### Aberystwyth University assignment

### Introduction
This project is an assignment for the module CS39820 of the computer science department in Aberystwyth University.

### Challenge
Design and build an app in swift to help the user learn vocabulary in the foreign language of her/his choice.

### Requirements
* On start-up, it will allow users to define two languages - their own language, and the foreign language they are learning. If this configuration is changed later, then all vocabulary is deleted.
* The app will allow users to note words they come across in whatever language they are learning, and the meaning of that word in their own language.
* When a word is noted, the word and its meaning will be added to a vocabulary list, and stored on the device.
* The user will be able to review their vocabulary list, in an attempt to learn the words they do not know.
* The user will be able to test themselves on the vocabulary list, and be told how well they have done on the test.

### Documentation
There is a complete report in pdf format available in the folder documentation. The report is written in a subjective format. This document aims to back up the code presented in the assignment.

### Design
There is a set of mock-up, final design and performance test in jpg format in the folder design.

### Application
The Xcode application written in Swift is the folder "Xcode project". The app does not have any dependencies or external assets.

#### Note from the author
My focus on this assignment was not just overcome the requirements given but achieving them with the minimum lines of code and with the minimum UI elements.
